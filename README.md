# PrankExam
Just a prank for some students

One of my friends is teaching high school maths, and we decided to pull a prank on the students :D Don't ask why though. 

# About the code
The code is extrememly primitive and inefficient. I had 2 afternoons to put it together, so this is just what popped into my juicebox. (Not to mention that I messed up the design on my first try, so I had to rebuild a new idea from the ground up - so I basically wrote this in one afternoon.)
